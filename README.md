# Movie Recommender System

## Discover Your Next Favorite Film!

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System! This interactive web application helps you discover new movies based on your preferences. Built with Streamlit, it provides personalized movie recommendations along with their posters, making your movie selection process seamless and enjoyable.

## Features

* **Interactive Movie Selection:** Easily select a movie from a comprehensive dropdown list.
* **Personalized Recommendations:** Get a list of 5 movies recommended based on the similarity to your selected movie.
* **Visual Appeal:** View movie posters for each recommendation, making it easier to identify and explore.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean and simple interface thanks to Streamlit.

## How It Works

The core of this system relies on calculating the similarity between movies. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1.  **Data Loading:** Movie data (titles and IDs) and a pre-calculated `similarity` matrix are loaded using `pickle`.
2.  **Similarity Calculation:** When you select a movie, its index is used to retrieve its similarity scores from the `similarity` matrix.
3.  **Top Recommendations:** The system identifies the top 5 most similar movies (excluding the selected movie itself).
4.  **Poster Fetching:** For each recommended movie, its `movie_id` is used to fetch the movie poster from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
5.  **Display:** The recommended movie titles and their posters are then displayed in a visually appealing grid.

## Future Enhancements

We're constantly working to improve this system! Upcoming features include:

* **Anime Integration:** Expanding the recommendation engine to include popular anime titles.
* **KDrama Integration:** Adding support for Korean Drama recommendations to cater to a wider audience.

## Technologies Used

* **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web application.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **requests:** For making API calls to fetch movie posters.
* **pickle:** For loading pre-trained data (movie dictionary and similarity matrix).
* **The Movie Database (TMDB) API:** For accessing movie information and posters.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/quree01/RecommendationSystem.git](https://github.com/quree01/RecommendationSystem.git)
    cd RecommendationSystem
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas requests
    ```
4.  **Obtain TMDB API Key:**
    * Sign up at [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup).
    * Get your API key from your [API settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
    * *Note: The current code has the API key hardcoded for demonstration purposes. For production, it's recommended to use environment variables.*
5.  **Prepare `movie_dict.pkl` and `similarity.pkl`:**
    These files contain the processed movie data and the similarity matrix. You'll need to generate these or obtain them from the project creator if they are not already in the repository. (Typically generated by a separate data processing script).

## Usage

Once you have set up the environment and obtained the necessary data files, run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py

##This will open the application in your web browser.
